# GPU-Viewer
A front-end to glxinfo and Vulkaninfo. 

This project aims to capture all the required/important details of glxinfo and vulkaninfo in a GUI. The project was developed 
using python 3 with tkinter (python-tk) programming. All the required/Important details were extracted using glxinfo with the
combination of grep, CAT , AWK commands and displayed in the front-end. There is no hard OpenGL Programming involved, until 
glxinfo works the GPU-viewer will also work

Currently Vulkan is in development. 

IMPORTANT
1. Need Python 3 to run this Application
2. Tested on Intel and Nvidia hardware
